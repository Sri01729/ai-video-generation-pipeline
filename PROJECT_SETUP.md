- Organize code by feature (controllers, services, routes).
- Use async/await for all I/O.

---

## Worker Service

### Core Functionality
- Processes long-running or resource-intensive jobs (audio generation, video assembly, browser automation).

### Why This Choice?
- Keeps backend API responsive.
- Isolates heavy/unstable tasks (e.g., browser automation) from main API.

### Integration
- Listens to Bull queues (Redis).
- Communicates with backend via shared DB or events.

### How It Works
- Consumes jobs from Redis.

```ts
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { getSignedUrl } from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner';

const s3 = new S3Client({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });
const command = new PutObjectCommand({
  Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET,
  Key: 'uploads/myfile.mp4',
  ContentType: 'video/mp4',
});
const url = await getSignedUrl(s3, command, { expiresIn: 3600 });
```

## Example User Workflow: From Auth to Final Video Output

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - User signs up or logs in via the frontend (Next.js) using AWS Cognito (email/password or OAuth).
   - Cognito issues a JWT, which is stored in the frontend and sent with all API requests.

2. **Video Creation Request**
   - Authenticated user submits a video creation form (prompt, title, etc.) on the dashboard.
   - Frontend sends a POST request to the backend `/api/videos` with the user's JWT.

3. **Backend: Job Creation**
   - Backend validates the JWT, creates a new video record in Supabase, and enqueues a processing job in Bull (Redis).
   - Returns a job ID and initial status to the frontend.

4. **Worker: Pipeline Processing**
   - Worker service picks up the job from the queue and runs the pipeline:
     1. **Script Generation**: Calls OpenAI to generate a video script from the user's prompt.
     2. **Voice Generation**: Uses Playwright to automate VoCloner, uploads script, downloads generated audio.
     3. **Audio Enhancement**: Automates voice.ai, uploads audio, downloads enhanced audio.
     4. **Caption Generation**: Sends audio to AssemblyAI for transcription and word-level timestamps.
     5. **Video Assembly**: Uses ffmpeg to combine background video, enhanced audio, and captions into a final video file.
     6. **Upload**: Uploads the final video to S3, updates Supabase with the video URL and status.

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - Backend exposes endpoints for job/video status.
   - Frontend polls or subscribes for real-time updates (status, progress, errors).

6. **User Accesses Final Video**
   - Once processing is complete, the user sees the video in their dashboard.
   - Frontend fetches a signed S3 URL for secure playback/download.

7. **(Optional) User Actions**
   - User can download, share, or delete their video.
   - All actions are protected by auth and validated by backend/Supabase RLS.
